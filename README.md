# QMNIST
The eMNIST-like dataset offers a rich collection of images featuring Cyrillic letters and Qazaq handwritten characters, serving as a valuable resource for training and testing machine learning models designed for text recognition and character classification tasks.
The repository consists of 19286 images (png extension, 278*278 size) representing all 42 letters of the Kazakh alphabet. Specifically, this dataset has 3339 images of only kazakh cyrillic letter. The dataset was obtained by drawing letters on the graphing table. 
Non-kazakh cyrillic letters were taken from [CoMNIST dataset](https://github.com/GregVial/CoMNIST).
